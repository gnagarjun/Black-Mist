# Black-Mist

Scene 1:

Detective John Smith walked into a bar and spotted Mike, his friend also a Sherif at the local county.
He walked over to him.

Detective: Hey, Mike. How is it going?

Sherif: Hey, John. Not really good. 

Detective: Why? What's wrong?

Sherif: Lot of pressure at work. A renowned scientist was found dead last week at his house. We suspect foul play. 
What disturbs us about this case is that XXXX was working with the government on a confidential project. We believe 
his death was somehow related to this.

Here's the file with all the details of the case. Good luck on the case!
